Mr. Brown is looking for his glasses
Miss Jackson did not appear
Tom had his socks on inside out
I got my hair cut
The ice will give under your weight
Court's adjourned
It's a quarter past nine
The cat meowed
I got some money from an ATM
I had my bicycle stolen
I've never climbed Mt
What is the scientific name for leech
You stink of cigarettes
Susan shined your father's shoes
I owe her thirty dollars
What an interesting novel this is
Let's not go to that restaurant again
The mothers sew
Tom drove to school
Maybe I exaggerated
A bee buzzes
He gave her mouth-to-mouth resuscitation
We ate some turtle soup
I met a wolf in a dream
What does the abbreviation GIA stand for
I missed the 7:00 train
Tom pocketed the keys
Tom turned a somersault
The drug smuggler was arrested at the airport
How much is this worth
She stained the wall beige
The boy carved his name into the tree
I've been subpoenaed
A man is holding a frog
Something bit me
The clocks in the city were striking ten
His pencil has been sharpened
The thermometer reads 10 degrees
No one's gambling
The top of Mt
The teapot broke
We always looked down on him
Tom had jet lag
Shall I carry your coat
My wisdom tooth hurts
I can't kiss you now
I had a tooth pulled
The penis entered the vagina
Her villa sits on the hill
Tom split the bill with Mary
Mary giggled
That was your plan, wasn't it
She attempted to kill herself
I twisted my ankle
The thermometer reads 30 degrees
He is named Jeff by everyone
